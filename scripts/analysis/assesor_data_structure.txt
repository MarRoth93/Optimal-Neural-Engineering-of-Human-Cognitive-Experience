# Data Type  
The data are Python dictionaries loaded from serialized pickle (`.pkl`) files. Each dictionary contains predicted scores for different manipulation levels (alpha values) applied to image features.  

# Path  
The data are stored at:  
`/home/rothermm/brain-diffuser/results/assessor_scores/<sub>/emonet_vdvae_sub<sub>.pkl`  
where `<sub>` refers to the subject identifier (1, 2, 5, or 7).  

# Keys  
Each dictionary has string keys representing different alpha manipulation levels:  
`'alpha_-4', 'alpha_-3', 'alpha_-2', 'alpha_0', 'alpha_2', 'alpha_3', 'alpha_4'`  

# Data  
Each key maps to a list of floating-point values of length 982, corresponding to predicted emotional scores for 982 test images at the respective alpha level.  

# Example Use  
```python
import pickle

sub = 1
path = f"/home/rothermm/brain-diffuser/results/assessor_scores/{sub}/emonet_vdvae_sub{sub:02d}.pkl"
with open(path, "rb") as f:
    data_vdvae = pickle.load(f)

# List available alpha levels
print(data_vdvae.keys())  # dict_keys(['alpha_-4', ..., 'alpha_4'])

# Access scores at alpha=0
alpha_0_scores = data_vdvae["alpha_0"]
print(len(alpha_0_scores))  # 982
